Gunning Fog Index
=================

The Gunning Fog Index is a readability metric that evaluates the complexity of a text. It was developed by Robert Gunning in 1952 with the aim of assessing the difficulty level of a reading material in English.

The index estimates the years of formal education required for someone to understand a text on first reading. For example, a Gunning Fog Index of 12 suggests that a reader would need approximately 12 years of education (around a US high school level) to understand the text.

The formula for calculating the Gunning Fog Index is:

---

## Gunning Fog Index = 0.4 * ((words/sentences) + 100 * (complex words/words))

Where:
- `words` is the number of words in the text,
- `sentences` is the number of sentences in the text, and
- `complex words` are words with three or more syllables.

The idea behind this formula is that texts with longer sentences and more complex words (i.e., words with more syllables) are more difficult to read. The index is widely used in the fields of education and publishing to assess the readability of different texts.
