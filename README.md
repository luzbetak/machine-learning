Machine learning (ML) is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on developing algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to learn and make decisions or predictions without being explicitly programmed to do so. In other words, machine learning involves training a model using data so that it can recognize patterns, make inferences, or generalize from experience.

The core idea behind machine learning is that by feeding a computer system a large amount of data, it can learn to identify patterns and relationships within that data, and then apply that knowledge to new, unseen data. This process typically involves:

1. **Collecting and preparing data:** Gathering a dataset and preprocessing it to remove noise, handle missing values, and convert it into a suitable format for the machine learning algorithm.
2. **Selecting a model:** Choosing an appropriate algorithm or model based on the problem you are trying to solve and the characteristics of the data.
3. **Training the model:** Providing the algorithm with a portion of the dataset (called the training set) to learn the patterns and relationships between input features and output targets.
4. **Evaluating the model:** Assessing the performance of the trained model using a separate portion of the dataset (called the validation or test set) to determine how well it generalizes to new data.
5. **Hyperparameter tuning and model selection:** Adjusting the settings of the algorithm to optimize its performance, or trying different models to find the one that performs best on the validation set.
6. **Deploying the model:** Integrating the trained model into an application or system to make predictions or decisions based on new data.

Machine learning can be categorized into three main types:

1. **Supervised learning:** The algorithm is provided with labeled data, where both input features and output targets are known. The goal is to learn the mapping from inputs to outputs, enabling predictions for unseen data. Common supervised learning tasks include classification and regression.
2. **Unsupervised learning:** The algorithm is provided with unlabeled data, meaning that only input features are given, and no output targets are provided. The goal is to discover underlying patterns or structures in the data, such as clustering or dimensionality reduction.
3. **Reinforcement learning:** This approach involves an agent learning to make decisions or take actions in an environment to maximize a reward signal. The agent learns from trial and error, adjusting its strategy over time based on feedback from the environment.

Machine learning has numerous applications, such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, recommendation systems, fraud detection, and autonomous vehicles.
