Random Forest Classifier
========================

A **Random Forest** is a powerful and popular machine learning algorithm that belongs to the class of ensemble methods. It builds upon the simple concept of decision trees.

Here's a more detailed explanation:

1. **Ensemble Method**: An ensemble method combines the predictions of several base estimators (like decision trees) built with a given learning algorithm in order to improve generalizability and robustness over a single estimator.

2. **Decision Trees**: Decision trees are a type of model used for both classification and regression. Trees answer sequential questions which send us down a certain route of the tree given the answer. The route leads to the final decision.

3. **Random Forest**: Random forest builds multiple decision trees and merges them together to get a more accurate and stable prediction. This is known as an ensemble method, where the predictions of several models are combined to make the final prediction, which is more robust and less prone to errors than a single model.

Key features of a random forest algorithm include:

- It is a supervised learning algorithm that can perform both regression and classification tasks.

- It can handle large datasets with high dimensionality effectively.

- It offers an effective method for estimating missing data and maintains accuracy for missing data.

- It provides a pretty good indicator of the feature importance.

- It has methods for balancing error in class population unbalanced datasets.

- It runs efficiently on large databases and can handle thousands of input variables without variable deletion. 

However, it's worth noting that while random forest can be incredibly powerful, it doesn't work well with very sparse data, such as text data, and is not suitable for making predictions over time, as in time series data.
