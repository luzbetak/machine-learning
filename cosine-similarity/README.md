Cosine Similarity Computation
=============================

Cosine similarity is a measure of similarity between two non-zero vectors in a multidimensional space. It is calculated by taking the dot product of the two vectors and dividing the result by the product of the magnitudes of the vectors. The cosine similarity ranges between -1 and 1, with -1 meaning the vectors are diametrically opposed, 1 meaning the vectors are identical, and 0 meaning the vectors are orthogonal or independent.

Mathematically, the cosine similarity between two vectors A and B is given by:

`CosineSimilarity(A, B) = (A . B) / (||A|| * ||B||)`

where `A . B` is the dot product of A and B, and `||A||` and `||B||` represent the magnitudes (Euclidean norms) of A and B, respectively.

Cosine similarity is commonly used in text analysis, natural language processing, and information retrieval to measure the similarity between documents or to find the similarity between words or phrases in a document. This is done by representing text as a vector in a high-dimensional space, where each dimension corresponds to a word or term in the vocabulary, and the value in each dimension represents the term's frequency or importance in the text.
