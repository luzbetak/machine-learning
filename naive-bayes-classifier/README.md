Naïve Bayes Classifier
======================

A **Naïve Bayes classifier** is a probabilistic machine learning model that is used for classification tasks. The crux of the model is the Bayes' theorem, and it's "naïve" because it makes the assumption that the presence of a certain feature in a class is unrelated to the presence of any other feature.

Here's a simple illustration. Suppose you're trying to determine whether an email is spam or not spam. A Naïve Bayes classifier considers all the words in the email, their frequencies, and whether they appear in spam or non-spam emails to make a prediction. It assumes that all words contribute independently to the probability that this email is spam, regardless of any possible correlations between the words. Hence, this is a 'naïve' assumption, giving the classifier its name.

Despite this oversimplification, Naïve Bayes classifiers have worked quite well in many complex real-world situations, including text classification and spam filtering. They are easy to implement, fast, efficient, and perform particularly well with high-dimensional datasets.
